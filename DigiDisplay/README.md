    // Set the video source
    videoSource.src = url;
    videoPlayer.load();
    
    this.currentVideo = url;
    // ... implementation
}
```

#### 2. TV Remote Navigation
```javascript
// Focus management for TV remote
setupFocusManagement() {
    document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
        if (e.key === 'ArrowDown' || e.key === 'ArrowRight') {
            // Navigate to next focusable element
        }
    });
}
```
